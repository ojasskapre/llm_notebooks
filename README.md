Welcome to this repository where we explore the intersection of language models, embeddings, and vector databases.

This repository serves as a playground and a proof-of-concept for integrating

- different language models like OpenAI, HuggingFace, Cohere, etc
- tools like LangChain, llama_index
- vector databases like Pinecone, Qdrant, Chroma, etc

The notebooks you will find in this repository document our exploration and understanding of these tools, and demonstrate how they can be used in tandem to create powerful AI applications. I believe that the combination of these technologies holds great promise for the future of AI, and we want to share my journey with the wider AI community.
